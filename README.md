# beagle_code

Hello world, this is beagle_code version 1 for pedagogical objetives, to introduce students to astrophysics fluid dynamics. It uses hll method to solve the Euler equations in 1 and 2d and is written in Fortran 90. 
For the case 2d is possible to generate a gnuplot file from fortran program included in the dyrectory. 
The initial conditions are included in the Fortran files.
